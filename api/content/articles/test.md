The Foreign & Commonwealth Office (FCO) helps British nationals abroad with a wide range of issues, from lost passports to serious emergencies.

In 2018, the FCO’s consular teams helped more than 200,000 British nationals around the world. Many of these cases were straightforward, but some were more unusual.

## Strictly Come Dancing
One British national contacted the FCO for help after losing their passport while on holiday in Italy. They needed to get back to the UK quickly as they were due to appear on the popular TV show Strictly Come Dancing.

The FCO was able to issue an emergency travel document so they could return to the UK in time for their appearance on the show.

## Vampires in Poland
Another British national contacted the FCO after being refused entry to a nightclub in Poland. The club had a strict dress code and did not allow patrons dressed as vampires.

The FCO advised the individual on their rights and helped them understand local laws and customs.
## Vegetarian sausages
A British national travelling in a remote part of Scotland contacted the FCO after struggling to find vegetarian food options, particularly vegetarian sausages.

The FCO provided information on local shops and restaurants that catered to vegetarian diets, helping them enjoy their trip.
## Contacting the FCO
If you need assistance while abroad, you can contact the FCO through their website or by visiting your nearest embassy or consulate. They are there to help with a wide range of issues, from lost passports to emergencies.
