The Department for Digital is pleased to announce the launch of the Samland Government website. The website has been redesigned to improve the clarity of information about the Samland project, simplify access to community resources, and assist users in locating relevant contact information for the project.

## Key improvements include:

- A refreshed and consistent design with standard page layouts and common site elements, ensuring a uniform appearance across the website.
- A responsive layout that adapts to mobile devices and desktop computers, providing a consistent user experience on a range of devices.
- An improved publishing process for news and press releases that enables authorised editors to publish updates more efficiently.
- Enhanced accessibility to support assistive technologies, facilitate keyboard navigation, and improve contrast for legibility.
- Consistent design patterns that facilitate future updates and the addition of further content types.

## Implications for visitors

Visitors will benefit from clearer navigation, improved page performance and content presented in a clear and readable format. Press releases and official updates present essential information such as date, category and author to assist users in locating relevant material.

## For content contributors

Organisations and individuals responsible for publishing content should follow the website's content guidelines to ensure consistency and accessibility. The new structure will assist editors in preparing and previewing material prior to publication.

## Feedback and contact

Members of the public who identify an issue or who wish to provide feedback are invited to use the Contact page or the feedback form on the website. Please include a concise description of the issue and the address of the page concerned. Feedback will be used to inform and prioritise subsequent improvements.

The Department for Digital thanks all contributors to this rollout. The website will be subject to ongoing improvement, including enhancements to search and the addition of further content, informed by user feedback.
