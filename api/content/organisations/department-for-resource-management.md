The Department for Resource Management oversees Samlandâ€™s world. We coordinate fair resource use,
protect scenic landscapes, and keep automation and farming practices server-friendly.
Our goal is to make sure the world stays playable, beautiful, and sustainable for all citizens.

## Environmental Stewardship

### Performance and Air Management
- **Monitoring Network**: Tracking server TPS, entity counts, and item loads
- **Automation Controls**: Rules for redstone, hoppers, and mob farms to prevent lag
- **Optimization Programs**: Promoting toggleable farms and efficient circuits
- **Public Dashboards**: Noticeboards and scoreboards with performance summaries

### Water and Landscape Care
- **River and Lake Protection**: Preserving natural waterways for boats and scenery
- **Cleanup Teams**: Clearing floating blocks and stray items from oceans and canals
- **Renewable Resources**: Supporting dripstone lava, kelp, and ice-based transport
- **Town Drainage**: Proper canal and hopper systems to manage excess items

### Land and Terrain Conservation
- **Mining Oversight**: Guidelines for quarrying and large-scale excavation
- **Craters and Damage**: Repair programs for TNT blasts and wither fights
- **Restoration Projects**: Landscaping abandoned mines and nether tunnels
- **Sustainable Farming**: Lag-friendly crop layouts and contained animal farms

## Resource Management Programs

### Sustainable Resource Gathering
- **Renewable Focus**: Tree farms, cobble and basalt generators, and villager trading
- **Mining Districts**: Designated zones to prevent strip-mining across the map
- **Reclamation**: Filling or decorating visible scars after resource extraction
- **Material Substitutes**: Promoting basalt, deepslate, and concrete for building

### Recycling and Reuse
- **Sorting Systems**: Automated item filters and bulk storage halls
- **Composting**: Turning leaves, seeds, and excess plants into bone meal
- **Safe Disposal**: Lava pits and controlled spaces for TNT and wither fights
- **Circular Economy**: Trading halls and community storage for shared use

### Automation and Efficiency
- **Optimized Farms**: On-demand designs with manual or timed switches
- **Fuel Management**: Encouraging bamboo, kelp blocks, and charcoal for smelting
- **Shared Infrastructure**: Public smelters, blast furnaces, and auto-brewers
- **Community Utilities**: Crop farms, mob grinders, and enchanting stations

## Wildlife and Biodiversity

### Habitat Protection
- **Protected Zones**: Coral reefs, mooshroom islands, and scenic forests
- **Mob Corridors**: Preserved beaches for turtles and wildflower fields for bees
- **Native Species Care**: Breeding programs for axolotls, bees, and turtles
- **Population Balance**: Preventing mob-cap hogging by large private farms

### Surveys and Monitoring
- **Biodiversity Counts**: Tracking bee nests, turtle beaches, and mob density
- **Health Indicators**: Monitoring spawn caps, despawn hot spots, and chunk stress
- **Farm Impact Reviews**: Assessing effects of large farms on natural spawns
- **Citizen Reports**: Players logging rare mobs and points of interest

## Education and Outreach

### Community Engagement
- **Guides and Workshops**: Teaching efficient redstone and lag-friendly farms
- **Green Certification**: Recognition for optimized and aesthetic builds
- **Volunteer Drives**: Tree-planting, river cleanup, and path lighting events
- **Noticeboards**: Public postings of rules, events, and resource maps

### Partnerships
- **Town Planning**: Working with builders on expansion and landscaping
- **Technical Sharing**: Adopting proven sorter and farm designs
- **Regional Projects**: Coordinating roads, nether hubs, and shared storage
- **Knowledge Exchange**: Learning from broader Minecraft technical communities

## Recent Achievements

### Server Health
- **Stable TPS**: Reduced lag through audits of redstone and farms
- **Toggleable Automation**: Most public farms equipped with proper off-switches
- **Restored Landscapes**: Quarries and nether tunnels landscaped and marked
- **Player Involvement**: High turnout for tree planting and restoration events

### Conservation Wins
- **Bee Recovery**: Flower belts established to support hive populations
- **Turtle Sanctuaries**: Hatchling beaches protected and maintained
- **Coral Preservation**: Reefs safeguarded from destructive harvesting
- **Lag Reduction**: Noticeable drop in item-related performance issues

## Future Goals

### 2030 Targets
- **Zero Chunk Loading Abuse**: All farms must shut down when unattended
- **Toggleable by Default**: No new farm may run without a manual or timed off-switch
- **Zero Litter**: Item cleanup systems in all community hubs
- **Expanded Preserves**: More biomes added to protected-zone lists

### Innovation and Tools
- **Monitoring Systems**: Scoreboards for TPS, entities, and item counts
- **Predictive Alerts**: Early warnings for builds likely to cause lag
- **Green Build Library**: Curated schematics for efficient farms and storages
- **Central Platforms**: Shared docs and maps for resource planning and reports
